# OOP Fundamentals
 Written to showcase the four core principles of object-oriented programming.
## Inheritance
* Allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.
* Promotes code reusability
## Abstraction
* Helps to reduce complexity by only exposing relevant information.
* An abstract class defines what a class should do, but not how.
## Polymorphism
* Means "to have many forms"
* Allows methods to have the same name but behave differently depending on the object calling them.
## Encapsulation (getters and setters)
* the concept of bundling variables and methods that operate on that data into a single class and restricting direct access to some of the objects.
